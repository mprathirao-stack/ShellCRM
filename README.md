Business Objective
Create an interactive app that helps Shell customer experience team quickly understand
customer sentiment and emerging issues across Shell gas stations in London by analyzing
their Google Reviews. The app should support both exploration (map + filters) and inquiry
(chatbot Q&A).
What the app should do
1) Summarize overall sentiment and experience drivers
Provide a clear, executive-friendly view of:
● Overall sentiment across all Shell stations in London (positive / neutral / negative)
● The main factors shaping sentiment (e.g., cleanliness, staff behavior, queues, pricing,
safety, toilets, EV charging, car wash)
● How sentiment is changing over time (e.g., last 30/90 days vs prior periods)
2) Identify emerging trends and “what’s getting worse or better”
The app should surface:
● Top recurring topics in reviews (good and bad)
● “Rising” complaints or praises (themes increasing recently)
● Stations that are improving vs deteriorating
● Notable spikes (e.g., sudden increase in complaints about service or cleanliness)
Required UI Features
Feature A: Map-based exploration
A map of London with Shell stations displayed as pins.
Users should be able to filter stations using a few practical controls, such as:
● Sentiment category (positive / neutral / negative)
● Rating range (e.g., 1–5)
● Review volume threshold (e.g., stations with > 20 reviews)
● Time period (e.g., last 30 / 90 / 365 days)
● Optional: Borough/area filtering (East/West/Central)
When a station is selected, show:
● Station overview (avg rating, sentiment summary, review volume)
● Top 3 positives and top 3 negatives (short excerpts)
● Key themes for that station (e.g., “queues,” “toilets,” “staff attitude”)
Feature B: Chatbot for targeted questions
A chat interface that answers questions based on the review insights.
It should handle queries like:
● “Which Shell stations have the most complaints about cleanliness?”
● “What are the top reasons for 1-star reviews?”
● “Which stations improved the most in the last 90 days?”
● “Are there any recurring mentions of safety concerns?”
● “Summarize common feedback about EV charging availability.”
Responses should:
● Be specific (name stations and themes)

● Provide supporting evidence (review snippets or examples)
● Clearly state when information is insufficient
